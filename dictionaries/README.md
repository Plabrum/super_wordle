This gist contains the contents of the dictionary Wordle uses as of January 27th, 2022. Wordle actually uses two dictionaries:

- La words that can be guessed and which can be the word of the day
- Ta words that can be guessed but are never selected as the word of the day

La contains 2,315 words, Ta contains 10,657 words. The lists are sorted alphabetically and only contain unique words. No word shows up in both lists, making for a total of 12,972 which can be guessed.
